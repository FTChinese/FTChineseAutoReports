Superhub has activated Office 365 users based on the user list provided by us and has successfully validated our domains on the Office 365 platform.
Currently, Superhub engineers have started migrating email data from our existing email system.

 It is expected that the migration will be completed next week, when we will discuss with Superhub on the date and schedule of switching over the email system to assist our colleagues in setting up the new email system.

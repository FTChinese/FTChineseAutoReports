The first migration of email data has been completed. The next step will be to switch the MX records for ftchinese.com, after which the current email system will be obsolete and we will have to use Office365 to send/receive all emails. Since it is not possible to setup the Office365 client before the MX record switch, we can temporarily use Webmail until the email client is setup on PCs and mobile devices.

We are in discussions with Superhub about switching MX records next Friday, which will give us time to achieve a second sync of email data by the end of next week, and then all colleagues will be able to use Office365 after the Labor Day holiday.

If appropriate, I will send out a notice and Office365 manual to all colleagues before the Labor Day holiday stating the switchover time.

We switched our MX records for ftchinese.com to the Microsoft Office 365 platform today. Everything seems to be going well so far. I tested sending and receiving emails on the new Office 365 platform successfully.

Superhub has already started to synchronize email data from the last few days.

In addition, I found that Office 365 cannot be set up in the regular email client on my phone, so I have to install an app called Oulook. we will assist our colleagues to set up their email clients, both computer and phone, after the holidays.

    I received an invoice from Superhub and we have submitted a payment request. In the meantime, Superhub's support technicians have worked out a timeline for completing the migration.

    We will confirm the list of migrated users, list of new users, portal IDs, etc. by next Monday. Verification of our domain ftchinese.com will take place next Tuesday. If the Office 365 license purchase is successful, the data migration will then begin.

    It is estimated that the entire migration can be completed within two weeks. We will do our best to prevent any surprises.
